# TerminalProject_DataScience

## Objective
Develop a system capable of analyzing and evaluating resumes based on job position requirements, assigning a compatibility score to each candidate.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preparation
Resumes and job descriptions provided by Laboratorios PiSA will be collected, cleaned, and preprocessed to ensure data quality, consistency, remove irrelevant information, and standardize formats.

### Feature Engineering
Key attributes for assessing candidate-job compatibility will be generated, including similarity measurements between resumes and job descriptions, extraction of specific skills, work experience, and education. These attributes will be transformed into numeric variables suitable for modeling.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP techniques such as tokenization, text normalization, and keyword extraction will be applied to analyze and structure the content of resumes and job descriptions effectively.

### Supervised Learning Model Development
A supervised classification and ranking model will be trained, evaluating various algorithms to identify the best performance in terms of accuracy and recall. Hyperparameter tuning will be conducted to optimize predictive quality.
